			When San To Chan successfully defended their PhD thesis, they
			received a gift of saltwater taffy to celebrate and couldn't help
			being intrigued by the taffy's unusual consistency: somewhere
			between a solid and liquid. That led to experiments investigating
			the taffy's rheology—how it deforms in response to applied
			forces—and how the ingredients and taffy-making process contribute
			to that rheology. The results are described in a new paper published
			in the journal Physics of Fluids.
		</p>
		<p>
			“Taffy is a viscoelastic material—it has properties between a
			viscous liquid and an elastic solid," said Chan, now a postdoc in
			the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab. "Comparing the
			deformation behavior of commercial taffy to those of different
			lab-made sugar syrups and lab-made taffies allowed us to identify
			the most important taffy ingredient (and material structure) that
			governs taffy rheology.”

			It's just the latest example of a burgeoning area of research
			focusing on the science of food—something that's frequently on the
			menu here at Ars. For instance, in 2020, physicists examined the
			physics of wok-tossed fried rice and found that the secret to a
			perfect dish (i.e., nicely browned but not burnt) was a timely
			combination of side-to-side and see-sawing motions while cooking. In
			2022, MIT physicists coined the term "oreology" for their study of
			why—when twisting two Oreo cookie halves apart—the creme filling
			typically sticks to only one chocolate wafer.

			The pandemic inspired physicists from the University of Illinois at
			Urbana-Champaign to investigate the physics of cooking pasta—first
			conducting home experiments, then repeating those with greater
			precision in the lab once the university reopened after lockdown.
			The most surprising finding was that the pasta noodles increased in
			length the longer they were cooked. There have been a surprisingly
			large number of scientific papers seeking to understand the various
			properties of spaghetti, both cooking and eating it—the mechanics of
			slurping the pasta into one's mouth, for instance; spitting it out
			(aka, the "reverse spaghetti problem"); or exploring the question of
			how to get dry spaghetti strands to break neatly in two, rather than
			three or more scattered pieces.

			Earlier this year, scientists explored whether making kimchi in
			traditional earthenware vessels known as onggi results in the best
			kimchi. Answer: it does; the porosity of the onggi's walls help the
			most desired bacteria proliferate during the fermentation process.
			Other scientists have studied the structure of cheese; investigated
			the composition and flow of gluten-free batter and breads;
			discovered why strands of honey can get so long and thin as they
			drip without actually breaking; figured out a way to get cocoa
			butter to distribute more evenly in chocolate to enhance the
			perceived texture; studied why Brazil nuts rise to the top of a can
			of mixed nuts (aka the "Brazil nut effect"); and figured out how to
			"tune" the flow of Swiss cheese fondue by adding cornflour or wine.
