            Air bubbles, oil droplets are the primary factors, plus emulsifiers
            for extra chewiness

                Saltwater taffy is made by stretching and pulling the sticky
                candy base to create air bubbles for a fluffy and chewy
                confection.

            When San To Chan successfully defended their PhD thesis, they
            received a gift of saltwater taffy to celebrate and couldn't help
            being intrigued by the taffy's unusual consistency: somewhere
            between a solid and liquid. That led to experiments investigating
            the taffy's rheology—how it deforms in response to applied
            forces—and how the ingredients and taffy-making process contribute
            to that rheology. The results are described in a new paper published
            in the journal Physics of Fluids.

            “Taffy is a viscoelastic material—it has properties between a
            viscous liquid and an elastic solid," said Chan, now a postdoc in
            the Fluid Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab. "Comparing the
            deformation behavior of commercial taffy to those of different
            lab-made sugar syrups and lab-made taffies allowed us to identify
            the most important taffy ingredient (and material structure) that
            governs taffy rheology.”

            It's just the latest example of a burgeoning area of research
            focusing on the science of food—something that's frequently on the
            menu here at Ars. For instance, in 2020, physicists examined the
            physics of wok-tossed fried rice and found that the secret to a
            perfect dish (i.e., nicely browned but not burnt) was a timely
            combination of side-to-side and see-sawing motions while cooking. In
            2022, MIT physicists coined the term "oreology" for their study of
            why—when twisting two Oreo cookie halves apart—the creme filling
            typically sticks to only one chocolate wafer.

            The pandemic inspired physicists from the University of Illinois at
            Urbana-Champaign to investigate the physics of cooking pasta—first
            conducting home experiments, then repeating those with greater
            precision in the lab once the university reopened after lockdown.
            The most surprising finding was that the pasta noodles increased in
            length the longer they were cooked. There have been a surprisingly
            large number of scientific papers seeking to understand the various
            properties of spaghetti, both cooking and eating it—the mechanics of
            slurping the pasta into one's mouth, for instance; spitting it out
            (aka, the "reverse spaghetti problem"); or exploring the question of
            how to get dry spaghetti strands to break neatly in two, rather than
            three or more scattered pieces.

            Earlier this year, scientists explored whether making kimchi in
            traditional earthenware vessels known as onggi results in the best
            kimchi. Answer: it does; the porosity of the onggi's walls help the
            most desired bacteria proliferate during the fermentation process.
            Other scientists have studied the structure of cheese; investigated
            the composition and flow of gluten-free batter and breads;
            discovered why strands of honey can get so long and thin as they
            drip without actually breaking; figured out a way to get cocoa
            butter to distribute more evenly in chocolate to enhance the
            perceived texture; studied why Brazil nuts rise to the top of a can
            of mixed nuts (aka the "Brazil nut effect"); and figured out how to
            "tune" the flow of Swiss cheese fondue by adding cornflour or wine.
