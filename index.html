					When San To Chan successfully defended their PhD thesis, they received
					a gift of
					<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Taffy_(candy)" rel=""
						>saltwater taffy</a
					>
					to celebrate and couldn't help being intrigued by the taffy's unusual
					consistency: somewhere between a solid and liquid. That led to
					experiments investigating the taffy's rheology—how it deforms in
					response to applied forces—and how the ingredients and taffy-making
					process contribute to that rheology. The results are described in a
					new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Taffy is a viscoelastic material—it has properties between a viscous
					liquid and an elastic solid," said Chan, now a postdoc in the Fluid
					Interfaces Group at MIT Media Lab. "Comparing the deformation behavior
					of commercial taffy to those of different lab-made sugar syrups and
					lab-made taffies allowed us to identify the most important taffy
					ingredient (and material structure) that governs taffy rheology.”

					It's just the latest example of a burgeoning area of research focusing
					on the science of food—something that's frequently on the menu here at
					Ars. For instance, in 2020, physicists examined the physics of
					wok-tossed fried rice and found that the secret to a perfect dish
					(i.e., nicely browned but not burnt) was a timely combination of
					side-to-side and see-sawing motions while cooking. In 2022, MIT
					physicists coined the term "oreology" for their study of why—when
					twisting two Oreo cookie halves apart—the creme filling typically
					sticks to only one chocolate wafer.
				</p>

					The pandemic inspired physicists from the University of Illinois at
					Urbana-Champaign to investigate the physics of cooking pasta—first
					conducting home experiments, then repeating those with greater
					precision in the lab once the university reopened after lockdown. The
					most surprising finding was that the pasta noodles increased in length
					the longer they were cooked. There have been a surprisingly large
					number of scientific papers seeking to understand the various
					properties of spaghetti, both cooking and eating it—the mechanics of
					slurping the pasta into one's mouth, for instance; spitting it out
					(aka, the "reverse spaghetti problem"); or exploring the question of
					how to get dry spaghetti strands to break neatly in two, rather than
					three or more scattered pieces.

					Earlier this year, scientists explored whether making kimchi in
					traditional earthenware vessels known as onggi results in the best
					kimchi. Answer: it does; the porosity of the onggi's walls help the
					most desired bacteria proliferate during the fermentation process.
					Other scientists have studied the structure of cheese; investigated
					the composition and flow of gluten-free batter and breads; discovered
					why strands of honey can get so long and thin as they drip without
					actually breaking; figured out a way to get cocoa butter to distribute
					more evenly in chocolate to enhance the perceived texture; studied why
					Brazil nuts rise to the top of a can of mixed nuts (aka the "Brazil
					nut effect"); and figured out how to "tune" the flow of Swiss cheese
					fondue by adding cornflour or wine.

					"Studying the physical principles associated with manipulating
					different foods might, in turn, stimulate discoveries of scientific,
					engineering, and engineering importance," Chan et al. wrote in their
					paper. In the case of saltwater taffy, a better understanding of its
					rheology, as well as that of other sugar-based confections, could
					enable artisans "to manipulate the material better, leading to novel
					techniques for creating designs with high artistic and cultural value,
					as well as enhanced control of their texture and mouthfeel."
